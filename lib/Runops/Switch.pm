=head1 NAME

Runops::Switch - Alternate runloop for the perl interpreter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    perl -MRunops::Switch foo.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an alternate runops loop. It's based on a large switch
statement, instead of function pointer calls like the regular perl one (in
F<run.c> in the perl source code.) I wrote it for benchmarking purposes.
